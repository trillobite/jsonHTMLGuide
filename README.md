jsonHTMLGuide
=============

You will need to download these files and run them with XAMPP or place on some kind of web server, this project is not officially hosted on any web server :(

Alternatively, if you are lucky and my development Koding session is active, you can have a look at this project while im developing it at http://trillobite.kd.io/jsonHTMLGuide/

This will be a complete guide for jsonHTML, which will soon be hosted. Written using jsonHTML.
